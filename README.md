# QREnote
 Unity 3D Android app for QR-based event booking.

QREnote is a Unity 3D built Android application (made for my Software Engineering exam) that works with a privately hosted XAMPP web-server and database, used to book events using QR Codes associated with each event id number.
It uses a combination of Vuforia + ZXing for the camera scanning system and simple UI Elements for user interaction, plus the Unity Web support for web requests to .php files in web server's folder.
